WoW Meta Mount Tracking
=======================

About
-----
This is designed to allow you to track a guild's progress on the specific acheievements needed for the tier meta for their mounts. E.G. http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=5828

The project is currently setup to meet my needs, but should be easy to edit to track your guild.

Why
--
I mainly made this to learn and play with the following:
*Github
*Script CFCs
*Blizzard's new API
